README: Housing Analysis and Machine Learning Pipeline

Overview

This project involves the analysis and prediction of housing prices using machine learning techniques. The code provided demonstrates how to load, preprocess, and model data for predictive analysis. It also includes visualization, correlation analysis, and model tuning to improve performance.

Prerequisites

Python 3.7+

Required Libraries:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

scikit-learn

Dataset

The dataset, housing.csv, should be placed in the same directory as the notebook or loaded into Colabâ€™s /content/ directory. It contains features such as geographical data, population, and median income.

Key Sections

1. Data Loading

The dataset is loaded using Pandas:

df = pd.read_csv('/content/housing.csv')

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized data distributions using histograms.

Examined geographical data using scatter plots.

Correlation analysis was conducted to identify relationships between features.

3. Data Preprocessing

Splitting Data:

Data was split into training and testing sets using multiple methods:

Random Splits: train_test_split from sklearn.

Stratified Sampling: To ensure income categories are proportionally represented.

Feature Engineering:

Created new features:

rooms_per_household

bedrooms_per_room

population_per_household

Handling Missing Data:

Imputed missing values using median strategy with SimpleImputer.

Encoding Categorical Features:

Applied one-hot encoding for the ocean_proximity feature.

4. Machine Learning Models

Models Trained:

Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

Model Evaluation:

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) was calculated for each model.

Cross-validation was used to ensure robustness.

Hyperparameter Tuning:

Used GridSearchCV to optimize Random Forest hyperparameters.

5. Feature Importance

Analyzed the importance of features in the Random Forest model to understand their impact on predictions.

Results

The Random Forest model outperformed other models in terms of RMSE after hyperparameter tuning.

Key influential features included median_income and engineered attributes like rooms_per_household.

Visualization

Visualizations were used to:

Analyze geographical data.

Understand feature distributions.

Visualize correlations and model predictions.

How to Run

Load the Dataset: Ensure the housing.csv file is available at the correct path.

Install Required Libraries:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

Execute the Notebook: Use Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook to run the code.

Future Improvements

Use additional feature engineering techniques.

Experiment with other machine learning algorithms like Gradient Boosting or XGBoost.

Deploy the final model using Flask or FastAPI for real-world applications.
